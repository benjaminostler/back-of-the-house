# Journal

## Week 13 (June 19th - June 23rd)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:

1. I was not able to contribute as much as I was easing back into Hack Reactor after a leave of absence due to family crisis. I told my teammates this and I hope they understood my circumstance. 
2. I spend most of my time catching up on material from Module 2 needed for the project.
3. I am still playing catch up with material from Module 2 and Module 3 as the others initialize the early stages of the project. 
4. Ed and Kenny worked on the project ahead of the others and the rest of us were not able to get started until their work was pushed onto main.

## Week 14 (June 26th - June 30th)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:
1. All group members successfully made merge requests by adding a journal of their own to the repo.
2. I spent most of my time this week still catching up on material needed for this project. I let my teammates know and I assume they were okay with this. 
3. Team continued to make progress during the early stages of the project.

## Week 15 (July 10th - July 14th)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:
1. Used the break to catch up on everything needed for this project. I am feeling ready to contribute to the project now. 
2. Alec, Benjamin, and I worked together to create the table for orders and migrated any changes that were made.
3. Alec, Benjamin, and I continuted to work on the backend endpoints for invoices and orders to essentially be completed by the end of the week.
4. We were able to finish creating the endpoints but we were dealing with migration errors.

## Week 16 (July 17th - July 21st)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:
1. Started incorporating foreign keys to our tables so we can pull data from other tables.
2. We decided to get rid of the orders and invoice table in replace of order_items table. We also decided to condense all the tables into one file "001_adding_all_tables.py". This is because of circular dependencies so doing it this way reduces the issues for that.
3. Me and Ben worked on the tables, queries, and routers for order_items. We had to wait for Alec and Edward to finish their endpoints to ensure that our endpoints would work.
4. Alec, Ben, and I spent a lot of time working on merge conflicts hoping to finish the order_items endpoints by today. I was able to fix an error that took a lot of time and got the endpoints to work.

## Week 17 (July 24th - July 28th)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:
1. Most of our backend endpoints are finished and functional. Most of us started to work on the frontend stuff. Ed worked on deployment of our frontend and backend and got it to work. Kenny was able to get auth to work as well. I work on the frontend for Reservations.
2. I was able to create the form for reservation but it was not actually being created due to an authentication error. I had to figure out how to create a form under a specific logged-in user. Ben and Alec are working on menu_items and orders. Ed worked on cart for our project and Kenny was working on the frontend for the login, signup, account details.
3. I am finally able to create a form while logged in for that specific account. I also created an edit form for Reservation and a delete functionality with a delete confirmation popup. The others are also still working on their frontend stuff. 
4. Presentation day: Spent the day cleaning up code, solving any merge conflicts with everyone and making sure everything was running on our deployed server. I did a lot of changes to the urls because it wasn't getting displayed properly on the deployed server. Eventually, I got it to work and all the reservation is working on the frontend. We presented and everything seemed to have went smoothly.
