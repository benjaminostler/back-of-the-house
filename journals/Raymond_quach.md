## Week 13 (June 19th - June 23rd)
1. During this week, I was not able to contribute as much as I was easing back into Hack Reactor after a leave of absence due to family crisis. I told my teammates this and I hope they understood my circumstance. 
2. I spend most of my time catching up on material from Module 2 needed for the project.
3. I am still playing catch up with material from Module 2 and Module 3 as the others initialize the early stages of the project. 
4. Ed and Kenny worked on the project ahead of the others and the rest of us were not able to get started until their work was pushed onto main.
