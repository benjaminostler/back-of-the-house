# Journal

## Week 13 (June 19th - June 23rd)
During this week, I worked on the following tasks:
1. I created ERD for the design of our restaurant app. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pWQop7rLnYlZO-vijExYePNbFCZVOuoy/view?usp=sharing
2. I created a Scrum Board on Trello to manage tasks. https://trello.com/b/BuAWzC6F/restaurant-scrum-board
3. Ed worked hard and did a lot but he was working on his personal repository and did not copy his code to the group's repository.  He told us to wait for him to copy it over before working on it so I wasn't able to run the app or work on it.
4. Kenny did a lot of work too but did not push his changes to main until later in the week which also made it difficult for me to contribute.

## Week 14 (June 26th - June 30th)
1. Ken finally pushed his changes to main:

2. Ed finally copied his work to our repository so we were able to clone and run fastapi & the react app. https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/merge_requests/2
3. I created my own branch and cloned the repository. Ed and Kenny helped me get the fastapi running, and use it to test completed endpoints. https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/merge_requests/9
4. I created my journal file and committed it to the repository. https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/merge_requests/14

## Week 15 (July 10th - July 14th)
1. Ed and Ken caught us up on things they had completed over the break.
2. I installed all of the coding software and etc on my laptop since I have been using my desktop until forced to use my laptop now.
3. Ed helped Alec create his journal file and commit it to the repository. https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/merge_requests/21
4. Alec, Raymond, and I worked together to create migration file for orders, then migrated the changes.
5. Alec, Raymond, and I split up the endpoints for invoices and orders between us to complete by the next day.
6.
