## Week 13 (June 19th - June 23rd)

During this week, I worked on the following tasks:

1. Created wireframes for the design of our restaurant app.
2. Created all API endpoints designs
3. Presented wireframes and endpoints to instructors

## Week 14 (June 26th - June 30th)

1. Ed [started the docker-compose.yaml](https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/commit/1f143d9ee7367a6ed2573a3c663b243ea0fbe937), there were issues deploying the project so I [redid our docker-compose.yaml](https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/commit/620af9a726360d5f76d130d6711bcb0f9a5fced8) as well as including pgadmin.
2. In addition to fixing the docker-compose.yaml, I [created the our first migration, queries, and router files](https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/commit/696f487279f5975932fb62171f73cac3dfa8665f) for the team to follow and apply. Specifically, for accounts. "Get all accounts" and "Create Account" endpoints were created specifically.
3. Found out that some members of the team have not began cloning the project repo and were having issues with initial docker deployment.
4. The team was still having trouble with git commands so I went over the proper steps with Ben and Ed. We had everyone make "test journal entries" as the document to push and commit to the main branch. The team was also struggling to understand how to properly sync sub-branches and create a merge request to main and apporoving it.
5. I went over with with the team how to create migrations and endpoints. Ben and Ed were present and Alec left after going over git commands. Raymond was not present due to family obligations.
6. Ed [added sections of his Mod2 frontend code](https://gitlab.com/backofthehouse/gastronomical-gems/-/commit/d89c8a68a470c18d76b5d9e97f2300b6322ca84e) to begin the frontend templates. Some features are appearing visually but no backend functionality.
7. I reminded and asked the team again to create endpoints based off my example with "accounts" over the break.

## Week 15 (July 10th - July 14th)

1. Ed showed the team how to create migrations. No git commits avaiable to link.
2. I asked Ed to create endpoints for "/menu_items" and Ben to create endpoints for "/order" as they've claimed they're caught up on the the curriculum.
