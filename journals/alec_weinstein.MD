Today I worked on creating API endpoints for orders with Ben and Raymond.

Today I created a table for orders and invoices. We are working out what fields to create for orders and the issue of multiple menu items in one order. I am reading about how restaurant order systems use SQL.

Last night I created queries and routes for Orders. Had an issue with my branch after having to clone the repo again and had to send the code to Ben, who will be pushing it to main and I will be pulling from.

The team collectively altered the Orders table and created and Orders_item table. I updated the queries and routers accordingly for Orders.

Began work on the main menu page, mostly in pseudo-code, and am refamiliarizing myself with React.

July 25

Continued working on Menu page, created Menu Item Details page, trying to use UseParams hook as a way of accessing menu items by their id to display them on that page. I allowed bootstrap to render after it wasn't because I noticed we were missing the scripts and link in our index.html.
